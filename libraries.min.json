See http://greensock.com/why-gsap/ for details. Other libraries like jQuery, Velocity, Transit, and Zepto only tween CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most flexible high-performance animation library on the planet. And unlike monolithic frameworks like Famo.us or Angular that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP simply owns the animation layer; sprinkle it wherever you want. GSAP stands for the GreenSock Animation Platform. There&#x27;s a jQuery plugin that hijacks the native jQuery.animate() method so that animations perform much better and additional properties can be tweened, like colors, transforms (2D and 3D), boxShadow, borderRadius, clip, and lots more. GSAP has no dependencies on jQuery or other libraries. See http://greensock.com/gsap/ for details.",

Three, in fact. A &quot;featured content&quot; slider, a &quot;start/stop slider&quot;, and &quot;moving boxes&quot;. Each of them had some cool interesting feature that I needed to build at the time. All were well-received, but as is the case with these things, people want them to do X, Y, and Z in addition to what they already did. This new AnythingSlider is an attempt at bringing together the functionality of all of those previous sliders and adding new features. In other words, to create a really &quot;full featured&quot; slider that could be widely useful. This is the first time (on CSS-Tricks) that one of these sliders is an actual plugin as well, which should make implementing it and customizing it much easier.",
